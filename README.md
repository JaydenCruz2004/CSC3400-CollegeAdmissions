Assignment 1: College Admissions

For this project, I've developed a Python program to assist with college admissions decisions by analyzing various data points from prospective students. The program reads student data from a CSV file, computes a weighted score for each applicant based on their GPA, SAT score, interest level, and other factors, and generates a list of top candidates for admission. It also identifies outlier students who may deserve further consideration due to unique circumstances, such as low demonstrated interest scores or discrepancies between GPA and SAT scores. Additionally, the program checks for grade improvement trends and outlier grades in student transcripts to provide a more comprehensive view of academic performance. The final output includes multiple files with lists of students recommended for admission based on various criteria, ensuring a fair and holistic approach to the admissions process.
